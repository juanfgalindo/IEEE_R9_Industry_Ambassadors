# IEEE_R9_Industry_Ambassadors
This repository has some files used in the IEEE R9 Industry Ambassadors Program for performance evaluation.

I added two files for scoring calculation:
	- scoring_calculation.py
	- scoring calculation.iynb
	
Both do the same, just one works on colab, and the other works locally.
